# ============================================================
# IMPORTANT: Disable Railway Git-based Auto-Deploy
# ============================================================
# To ensure deployments ONLY happen via GitHub Actions:
#
# 1. Go to Railway Dashboard (railway.app)
# 2. Select your project
# 3. For EACH service (auth, category, coupon, gateway, order, product):
#    - Click on the service
#    - Go to Settings tab
#    - Under "Source" section, disable "Automatic Deployments"
#    - Or disconnect the GitHub repo if connected directly
#
# This ensures Railway only deploys when triggered by this workflow.
